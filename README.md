# GalleryGuide

## Proposal

### Idea
GalleryGuide allows users to find works of art and to learn more about their composers.

### APIs
- Art Institute of Chicago Public API (artwork): https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api

### Models
#### Artworks
- Instances:
- Sortable attributes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Media: 1, 2
- Connection to other models: 
#### Artists
- Instances:
- Sortable attributes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Media: 1, 2
- Connection to other models:
#### Galleries/Museums
- Instances:
- Sortable attributes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Media: 1, 2
- Connection to other models: 

## Organizational Technique
We intended to use the standard organizational model with a page for each model populated by instances of that model.

## Questions
- What works of art did an artist create?
- Where can I go to see a work of art?
- What art does a gallery have?
