22	Eugène Atget	Eugène Atget was a French flâneur and a pioneer of documentary photography, noted for his determination to document all of the architecture and street scenes of Paris before their disappearance to modernization. Most of his photographs were first published by Berenice Abbott after his death. Though he sold his work to artists and craftspeople, and became an inspiration for the surrealists, he did not live to see the wide acclaim his work would eventually receive.	1857	1927	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/7dw-fxPn9OUHrFnT2mxuzw/four_thirds.jpg	47	1
1	Pablo Picasso	Born in Málaga, Spain, in 1881, Pablo Picasso showed an early passion for drawing. His father, an art teacher, began giving him lessons in figure drawing and oil painting at the age of seven. Picasso enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Barcelona and then at Madrid, but withdrew from formal training in 1899 to return to Barcelona, where he worked as a graphic artist. In 1900, Picasso made his first visit to Paris, and until 1904, he split his time between Paris and Barcelona.\n\nLate in 1901, Picasso began making paintings on themes of desolation and despair, depicting solitary and melancholy figures in paintings flooded with blue. In 1904, Picasso began his Rose Period, lightening his palette from the dark, moody blues of the previous years in favor of beige, red, and rose tones. Casting aside the melancholy subjects of the Blue Period, Picasso painted circus perform- ers, harlequins, and clowns.\n\nAfter meeting Georges Braque in 1907, Picasso and Braque worked closely together to develop Cubism. By 1910, they had developed a distinctive Cubist idiom, fracturing their subjects into small, faceted forms and working with a muted palette. Rejecting the traditional depiction of three-dimensional objects from one viewpoint, they instead represented the subject from a multitude of perspectives. In 1912, Picasso and Braque began experimenting with collage and papier collé, introducing real elements, such as newsprint, artificial wood, and wallpaper, into their paintings to achieve trompe-l’oeil effects. By 1911–12, Cub- ism had become popular as the latest avant-garde movement and progressive painters across Europe began painting in Cubist styles.\n\nAfter the upheaval of World War One, Picasso - together with other European artists including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, and Fernand Léger - returned to a more traditional artistichis exploration of Cubism, often painting works in remarkably different styles in a period of only a few hours.\nBy 1927, Picasso began experimenting with Surrealist imagery, incorporating morphed and distorted figures in his paintings. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Picasso reacted with explicit, emotional works, painting the masterpiece Guernica in response to the bombing of the town by the fascist Generalissimo Francisco Franco in 1937.\n\nFrom the late 1940s through the 1960s, Picasso worked primarily in the south of France, where he painted, made ceramics, and experimented with printmaking. In the 1950s, Picasso began reinterpreting the work of the great masters, making paintings based on Velázquez, Goya, Manet, Courbet, and Delacroix. During the 1950s, Picasso’s international fame increased greatly with large exhibitions and retrospectives across the world. He continued to work prolifically through his eighties and nineties. He died in 1973, leaving behind an unparalleled legacy that has shaped the development of modern and contemporary art.	1881	1973	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/i3rCA3IaKE-cLBnc-U5swQ/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
3	Pierre-Auguste Renoir	Pierre-Auguste Renoir was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that "Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau."	1841	1919	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/3FBfL2Hs7UzA402R3UM2DQ/four_thirds.jpg	73	1
2	Paul Klee	Paul Klee was a Swiss-born German artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included expressionism, cubism, and surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory, published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting was for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture in Germany. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.	1879	1940	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/VTSBwo2xots6FIJkt9HVvg/four_thirds.jpg	2	1
61	Thomas Rowlandson	Thomas Rowlandson was an English artist and caricaturist of the Georgian Era, noted for his political satire and social observation. A prolific artist and printmaker, Rowlandson produced both individual social and political satires, as well as a large number of illustrations for novels, humorous books, and topographical works. Like other caricaturists of his age such as James Gillray, his caricatures are often robust or bawdy. Rowlandson also produced highly explicit erotica for a private clientele; this was never published publicly at the time and is now only found in a small number of collections. His caricatures included those of people in power such as the Duchess of Devonshire, William Pitt the Younger and Napoleon Bonaparte.	1756	1827	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/C1eVXPsJ_SgOB7QZTtb7Dw/four_thirds.jpg	81	1
23	John Beasley Greene	John Beasley Greene was a French-born American Egyptologist and one of the earliest archaeological documentary photographers. He died at the age of 24. Because of his early demise, his pioneering work was quickly forgotten. The first important study of Greene was published in 1981.	1832	1856	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/dqyr-PYqF04W1LY3Eldr-w/four_thirds.jpg	2	1
62	Peter Paul Rubens	Sir Peter Paul Rubens was a Flemish artist and diplomat from the Duchy of Brabant in the Southern Netherlands. He is considered the most influential artist of the Flemish Baroque tradition. Rubens's highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the Counter-Reformation. Rubens was a painter producing altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects. He was also a prolific designer of cartoons for the Flemish tapestry workshops and of frontispieces for the publishers in Antwerp.	1577	1640	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/kEmtynKqwyfJh8Z04fV2YQ/four_thirds.jpg	22	1
33	Ernst Ludwig Kirchner	Ernst Ludwig Kirchner was a German expressionist painter and printmaker and one of the founders of the artists group Die Brücke or "The Bridge", a key group leading to the foundation of Expressionism in 20th-century art. He volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown and was discharged. His work was branded as "degenerate" by the Nazis in 1933, and in 1937 more than 600 of his works were sold or destroyed.	1880	1938	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/LGmpL51gk6pf3gIwhKgVrw/four_thirds.jpg	37	1
63	Karl Friedrich Schinkel	Karl Friedrich Schinkel was a Prussian architect, city planner and painter who also designed furniture and stage sets. Schinkel was one of the most prominent architects of Germany and designed both neoclassical and neogothic buildings. His most famous buildings are found in and around Berlin.	1781	1841	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/9DS5INOCwfSUVNn0qCTOhw/four_thirds.jpg	9	1
64	Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo	Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo was an Italian painter and printmaker in etching. He was the son of artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and elder brother of Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo.	1727	1804	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/6Uz0Ur2YCmLueNfR4kwvmQ/four_thirds.jpg	47	1
81	Carlo Dolci	Carlo Dolci was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active mainly in Florence, known for highly finished religious pictures, often repeated in many versions.	1616	1687	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/fnUIZaboFWn1eF1Ze-wlRA/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
65	J. M. W. Turner	Joseph Mallord William Turner, known in his time as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colouring, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper. He was championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.	1775	1851	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/TYRLf31603hwyH1jmCivfg/four_thirds.jpg	59	1
80	Annibale Carracci	Annibale Carracci was an Italian painter and instructor, active in Bologna and later in Rome. Along with his brother and cousin, Annibale was one of the progenitors, if not founders of a leading strand of the Baroque style, borrowing from styles from both north and south of their native city, and aspiring for a return to classical monumentality, but adding a more vital dynamism. Painters working under Annibale at the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese would be highly influential in Roman painting for decades.	1560	1609	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/gda1oPVwuXg4cU-8PWUdoQ/four_thirds.jpg	22	1
4	Paul Cézanne	Paul Cézanne (19 January 1839  22 October 1906) was a French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th century conception of artistic endeavor to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century. Cézanne can be said to form the bridge between late 19th century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, Cubism. The line attributed to both Matisse and Picasso that Cézanne "is the father of us all" cannot be easily dismissed. Cézanne's work demonstrates a mastery of design, colour, composition and draftsmanship. His often repetitive, sensitive and exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields, at once both a direct expression of the sensations of the observing eye and an abstraction from observed nature. The paintings convey Cézanne's intense study of his subjects, a searching gaze and a dogged struggle to deal with the complexity of human visual perception.	1839	1906	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Q7dKvB7AKUMnziCM_CSmtQ/four_thirds.jpg	113	1
27	Julia Margaret Cameron	Julia Margaret Cameron was a British photographer who is considered one of the most important portraitists of the 19th century. She is known for her soft-focus close-ups of famous Victorian men and women, for illustrative images depicting characters from mythology, Christianity, and literature, and for sensitive portraits of men, women and children.	1815	1879	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/I2_ig39j7WyWkuDURREPGg/four_thirds.jpg	16	1
5	Vincent van Gogh	Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not commercially successful in his career, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, which eventually led to his suicide at age thirty-seven.	1853	1890	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/wMhDVMZP68ERKRVE_c1k-g/four_thirds.jpg	31	1
28	Édouard Baldus	Édouard Baldus was a French landscape, architectural and railway photographer.	1813	1882	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/slCVFp-GLFC5cyF8__aHVA/four_thirds.jpg	12	1
6	Jean-François Millet	Jean-François Millet was a French artist and one of the founders of the Barbizon school in rural France. Millet is noted for his paintings of peasant farmers and can be categorized as part of the Realism art movement. Toward the end of his career, he became increasingly interested in painting pure landscapes. He is known best for his oil paintings but is also noted for his pastels, conte crayon drawings, and etchings.	1814	1875	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/hfWJsYsofdq8YARg--od_A/four_thirds.jpg	11	1
7	Gustave Courbet	Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet was a French painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work.	1819	1877	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/m147DuaKLgDU9NgqarYYZw/four_thirds.jpg	11	1
8	Édouard Manet	Édouard Manet was a French modernist painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, as well as a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.	1832	1883	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/r0sxPCAkXuSt8L1N4156Aw/four_thirds.jpg	56	1
31	George N. Barnard	George Norman Barnard was an American photographer most well known for his photographs from the American Civil War era. He is often noted as G. N. Barnard.	1819	1902	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/C_5MfSCBIG0mEqO7AX8hWg/square.jpg	3	1
60	Nicolas Poussin	Nicolas Poussin was the leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscape in his paintings. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cézanne.	1594	1665	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/-ciQyfNHa6AYdO9mjKS6kg/four_thirds.jpg	10	1
32	Timothy H. O'Sullivan	Timothy H. O'Sullivan was a photographer widely known for his work related to the American Civil War and the Western United States.	1840	1882	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/hQ_7XHzgci6aEOmu-FFI8g/four_thirds.jpg	7	1
29	Roger Fenton	Roger Fenton was a British photographer, noted as one of the first war photographers.	1819	1869	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/fxzzdoqiURG6CMQ39kRMCg/four_thirds.jpg	12	1
25	Lewis Wickes Hine	Lewis Wickes Hine was an American sociologist and muckraker photographer. His photographs were instrumental in bringing about the passage of the first child labor laws in the United States.	1874	1940	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/YHJXTYrjGPyi-VkjT513tw/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
26	Gertrude Käsebier	Gertrude Käsebier was an American photographer. She was known for her images of motherhood, her portraits of Native Americans, and her promotion of photography as a career for women.	1852	1934	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/bnokZYFn1V9ebOy2obf2dA/four_thirds.jpg	6	1
30	Auguste Salzmann	Auguste Salzmann (1824–1872) was a French archaeologist, painter, and pioneer in the field of archaeological photography.	1824	1872	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/b2Y2PkjxYy1QXm4dnZ4ZqQ/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
71	Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller	Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller was an Austrian painter and writer. Waldmüller was one of the most important Austrian painters of the Biedermeier period.	1793	1865	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/5RZZEGQnY94zuHTMZJ2ekw/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
11	Edgar Degas	Edgar Degas was a French Impressionist artist famous for his pastel drawings and oil paintings.	1834	1917	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/iGsITIKPLduM2Heo3r_erA/four_thirds.jpg	111	1
12	Berthe Morisot	Berthe Marie Pauline Morisot was a French painter and a member of the circle of painters in Paris who became known as the Impressionists.	1841	1895	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/hITYV_ikLHt7Lnvxplkklw/four_thirds.jpg	22	1
21	Egon Schiele	Egon Leo Adolf Ludwig Schiele was an Austrian Expressionist painter. His work is noted for its intensity and its raw sexuality, and for the many self-portraits the artist produced, including nude self-portraits. The twisted body shapes and the expressive line that characterize Schiele's paintings and drawings mark the artist as an early exponent of Expressionism. Gustav Klimt, a figurative painter of the early 20th century, was a mentor to Schiele.	1890	1918	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/KoTOfdDcFB5djqXOjIKjNw/four_thirds.jpg	4	1
13	Alexandre Cabanel	Alexandre Cabanel was a French painter. He painted historical, classical and religious subjects in the academic style. He was also well known as a portrait painter. According to Diccionario Enciclopedico Salvat, Cabanel is the best representative of L'art pompier, and was Napoleon III's preferred painter.	1823	1889	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/0lIx2vRiq60AxLNSClv3dA/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
14	Rosa Bonheur	Rosa Bonheur was a French artist known best as a painter of animals (animalière). She also made sculpture in a realist style. Her paintings include Ploughing in the Nivernais, first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1848, and now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, and The Horse Fair, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1853 and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Bonheur was widely considered to be the most famous female painter of the nineteenth century.	1822	1899	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/14ISvthVLlIoeIcqkb5j6w/four_thirds.jpg	3	1
20	Lewis Carroll	Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English author, poet and mathematician. His most notable works are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass (1871). He was noted for his facility with word play, logic, and fantasy. His poems Jabberwocky (1871) and The Hunting of the Snark (1876) are classified in the genre of literary nonsense.	1832	1898	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/2dryxCbwcfNrTy9Z9D-UbA/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
9	James Abbott McNeill Whistler	James Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American painter active during the American Gilded Age and based primarily in the United Kingdom. He eschewed sentimentality and moral allusion in painting and was a leading proponent of the credo "art for art's sake". His signature for his paintings took the shape of a stylized butterfly possessing a long stinger for a tail. The symbol combined both aspects of his personality: his art is marked by a subtle delicacy, while his public persona was combative. He found a parallel between painting and music, and entitled many of his paintings "arrangements", "harmonies", and "nocturnes", emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony. His most famous painting, Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 (1871), commonly known as Whistler's Mother, is a revered and often parodied portrait of motherhood. Whistler influenced the art world and the broader culture of his time with his theories and his friendships with other leading artists and writers.	1834	1903	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ijKHbMcxF9yaahXfToelVQ/four_thirds.jpg	104	1
10	Claude Monet	Claude Monet, born Oscar Claude Monet (14 November 1840  5 December 1926) was a founder of French impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-airlandscape painting. The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant).	1840	1926	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/95EYpbkhcWsEKG18njyhCw/four_thirds.jpg	33	1
15	Gustave Caillebotte	Gustave Caillebotte was a French painter who was a member and patron of the Impressionists, although he painted in a more realistic manner than many others in the group. Caillebotte was known for his early interest in photography as an art form.	1848	1894	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/e1czHEBAgB4JfhkoKLT0HA/four_thirds.jpg	2	1
17	Franz Marc	Franz Moritz Wilhelm Marc was a German painter and printmaker, one of the key figures of German Expressionism. He was a founding member of Der Blaue Reiter, a journal whose name later became synonymous with the circle of artists collaborating in it.	1880	1916	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/k5NfF-fxG-PQaAPTgsJMyw/four_thirds.jpg	6	1
19	Carleton E. Watkins	Carleton E. Watkins (1829–1916) was an American photographer of the 19th century. Born in New York, he moved to California and quickly became interested in photography. He focused mainly on landscape photography, and Yosemite Valley was a favorite subject of his. His photographs of the valley significantly influenced the United States Congress' decision to preserve it as a National Park.	1829	1916	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/gP-_fZ98XoBTjHT7ZsuiBA/four_thirds.jpg	56	1
18	Eadweard Muybridge	Eadweard Muybridge was an English photographer known for his pioneering work in photographic studies of motion, and early work in motion-picture projection. He adopted the first name "Eadweard" as the original Anglo-Saxon form of "Edward", and the surname "Muybridge", believing it to be similarly archaic.	1830	1904	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/9tKQlzz_7wgKFD609otlyQ/four_thirds.jpg	20	1
24	Walker Evans	Walker Evans was an American photographer and photojournalist best known for his work for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) documenting the effects of the Great Depression. Much of Evans' work from the FSA period uses the large-format, 8×10-inch (200×250 mm) view camera.

34	Marsden Hartley	A pioneering modernist painter who was part of the circle of artists around legendary dealer Alfred Stieglitz, Hartley painted landscapes, portraits, and still lifes imbued with a spiritual expressiveness. Whether treating the mysticism of Native American cultures, the hardiness of rural Maine, or the military pageantry of pre-World War I Germany, Hartley's works encompass the defining nature of his subjects, and seek to represent much more than observed reality. Hartley possessed a deep attachment to nature, and for him, a Maine landscape was not simply a picturesque view, but rather something evoking the profound geologic power as well as the poetic isolation of the state where he was born. \n\nHartley, who worked primarily in oil, also produced a number of pastels over the course of his career, and for a brief period, he experimented with painting on glass. Although rooted in reality, Hartley's works selectively emphasize certain visual elements of a scene, endowing them with a monumentality that reflects what he saw as their spiritual and symbolic nature. This effect is often heightened by his use of strongly outlined forms and flattened space. His variety of subjects look back upon the many places he lived and visited during his peripatetic life -- Maine, Paris, Germany, Mexico, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Cape Cod, Gloucester, Nova Scotia, Bermuda, and the south of France among them.	1877	1943	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/qx14_-bzomniTo1-iuF3xg/four_thirds.jpg	2	1

In addition, he was a painter and a man of the theater: he wrote, directed and acted in plays, for which he designed stage sets and theatrical machinery. He produced designs as well for a wide variety of decorative art objects including lamps, tables, mirrors, and even coaches.	1598	1680	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/FExS5aJGsOSXVq3_XgOe2g/four_thirds.jpg	6	1

In Germany and Poland, Bellotto called himself by his uncle's name, Canaletto. This caused some confusion, however Bellotto’s work is more sombre in color than Canaletto's and his depiction of clouds and shadows brings him closer to Dutch painting.	1721	1780	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/rlNIvuOKLg-B0R6ciH-rMg/four_thirds.jpg	3	1

Vasari designed the Tomb of Michelangelo in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence that was completed in 1578. Based on Vasari's text in print about Giotto's new manner of painting as a rinascita (rebirth), author Jules Michelet in his Histoire de France (1835) suggested adoption of Vasari's concept, using the term Renaissance to distinguish the cultural change.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes, which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs "the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension".	1774	1840	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/NXezmWPbnaMs24yETKAx4w/four_thirds.jpg	6	1

Watteau is credited with inventing the genre of fêtes galantes, scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm, suffused with a theatrical air. Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of Italian comedy and ballet.	1684	1721	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/6LQKp9OryYzNFkuyISxMqw/four_thirds.jpg	23	1

From the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Velázquez's artwork was a model for the realist and impressionist painters, in particular Édouard Manet. Since that time, more modern artists, including Spain's Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí, as well as the Anglo-Irish painter Francis Bacon, have paid tribute to Velázquez by recreating several of his most famous works.	1599	1660	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/e5gJxWJvsh5EO7bElRWkqQ/four_thirds.jpg	5	1

Ugo claimed to be the first to use this technique, seeking a copyright first from the Venetian senate, and later from Pope Leo X. Although he did not create the chiaroscuro woodcut technique, he was one of the first Italian practitioners. He contributed to its development through his powerful style, focus on tonality and interpretive skills. One of his most famous works is a print of Diogenes. In addition to his numerous prints, he produced a writing book, and is also known to have produced at least one painting, the altarpiece of Saint Veronica in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome.	1480	1523	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/kZrCYjXcEXrulnwMPTDqjg/four_thirds.jpg	1	1

He was influenced by van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden and is noted for his innovations with linear perspective and a meticulous technique which seems derived from miniatures and manuscript illumination. Today, some 30 works are confidently attributed to him. The best known include the Portrait of a Carthusian (1446) and Portrait of a Young Girl ; both are highly innovative in the presentation of the figure against detailed, rather than flat, backgrounds.	1410	1475	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/9BBIuSlrXWRy42ZAuT34uQ/four_thirds.jpg	5	1

100	Kasimir Severinovich Malevich	Kazimir Severinovich Malevich was a Ukrainian artist and art theorist, whose pioneering work and writing had a profound influence on the Russian avant-garde movement and development of abstract art in the 20th century. Born in Kiev to an ethnic Polish family, Malevich identified as Ukrainian in his autobiography and later works. Malevich's concept of Suprematism sought to develop a form of expression that moved as far as possible from the world of natural forms (objectivity) and subject matter in order to access "the supremacy of pure feeling" and spirituality. Malevich is also considered to be part of the Ukrainian avant-garde that was shaped by Ukrainian-born artists who worked first in Ukraine and later over a geographical span between Europe and America.	1878	1935	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Pwq2eoTMbl_vINVj2ooM3A/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
94	Mary Cassatt	One of only three women -- and the only American, woman or man -- invited to exhibit with the Impressionists in Paris, Cassatt spent the majority of her career abroad. In addition to producing her distinctive images of women and children, Cassatt also served as an advisor to important American collectors including Henry and Louisine Havemeyer, whose collection became a cornerstone of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Philadelphia-born Cassatt studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts before setting off for Europe, where she eventually became a friend and colleague of Edgar Degas. Widely recognized on both sides of the Atlantic and considered one of the greatest living artists of her time, Cassatt was viewed as a truly "modern" woman, and she lent her efforts to help American women earn the right to vote. \nCassatt produced her characteristic figurative works in oil and pastel, and was also a highly accomplished printmaker and etcher. She owned a collection of Japanese prints, and the harmonious colors and flattened forms that characterize her style indicate the influence of Japonisme upon her work. She frequently employed friends and family members as her subjects, and the ensuing works explore themes of family, femininity, and daily life.	1844	1926	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ST7tBD1QPZEYaGW8-xJrvw/four_thirds.jpg	59	1
95	Guercino	Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, better known as (il) Guercino, was an Italian Baroque painter and draftsman from Cento in the Emilia region, who was active in Rome and Bologna. The vigorous naturalism of his early manner contrasts with the classical equilibrium of his later works. His many drawings are noted for their luminosity and lively style.	1591	1666	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/TdlAF_GsoGVG-0V2gDDkZg/four_thirds.jpg	14	1

103	Paul Gauguin	Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin was a French Post-Impressionist artist. Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of colour and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region.	1848	1903	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/jsaOG8cOknnRajFUmbnn9g/four_thirds.jpg	126	1

102	Suzuki Harunobu	Suzuki Harunobu was a Japanese designer of woodblock print art in the ukiyo-e style. He was an innovator, the first to produce full-color prints in 1765, rendering obsolete the former modes of two- and three-color prints. Harunobu used many special techniques, and depicted a wide variety of subjects, from classical poems to contemporary beauties. Like many artists of his day, Harunobu also produced a number of shunga, or erotic images. During his lifetime and shortly afterwards, many artists imitated his style. A few, such as Harushige, even boasted of their ability to forge the work of the great master. Much about Harunobu's life is unknown.	1725	1770	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/6PE8qVQw23u-hw2OpG1SgA/four_thirds.jpg	1	1

89	Francisco de Goya	Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker. He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th- and 20th-century painters. Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.	1746	1828	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/rdotrPHi1YqDgOcKDTpsvw/four_thirds.jpg	129	1
91	Paolo Veronese	Paolo Caliari, known as Paolo Veronese, was an Italian Renaissance painter based in Venice, known for extremely large history paintings of religion and mythology, such as The Wedding at Cana (1563) and The Feast in the House of Levi (1573). Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the "great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the cinquecento" and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian.	1528	1588	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/s-N0UMXbyjgobc68RJdwvw/four_thirds.jpg	10	1
93	Wassily Kandinsky	Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky was a Russian painter and art theorist. Kandinsky is generally credited as one of the pioneers of abstraction in western art, possibly after Hilma af Klint. Born in Moscow, he spent his childhood in Odessa, where he graduated at Grekov Odessa Art School. He enrolled at the University of Moscow, studying law and economics. Successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship at the University of Dorpat —Kandinsky began painting studies at the age of 30.	1866	1944	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/-biSpkdpnHtjCKo_mDRCNQ/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
92	François Boucher	François Boucher was a French painter, draughtsman and etcher, who worked in the Rococo style. Boucher is known for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative allegories, and pastoral scenes.

88	Robert Henri	A highly influential painter and teacher, Henri championed urban realism and is viewed as the leader of The Eight and the Ashcan School. The Cincinnati-born Henri studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and in Europe before establishing himself in New York. Although highly successful, he chafed at the conservative nature of the city's art establishment, and created controversy when in 1908 he helped to organize and participated in an independent exhibition with a group of artists who together would come to be known as The Eight. This group (the core of the so-called Ashcan School) broke new ground in their choice of subject matter, focusing on scenes of everyday urban life in New York, without overlooking its grittier side. \n\nHenri painted landscapes and city scenes, although he concentrated primarily on portraiture and figural work. He depicted all sorts of individuals, from street urchins to exotic foreigners to elegant young women. In choosing subjects regardless of their race or economic status, he democratized a genre of painting that had traditionally focused on the upper classes. Henri's work is characterized by bold, slashing brushstrokes and generous application of paint. He progressively incorporated more color into his palette, particularly after 1909, when he became interested in color theory. He also worked frequently in pastel over the course of his career.	1865	1929	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/4sOuUkhKu6K1J0B20nI7AQ/four_thirds.jpg	3	1

During this time, "Vouet was indisputably the leading artist in Paris," and was immensely influential in introducing the Italian Baroque style of painting to France. He was also "without doubt one of the outstanding seventeenth-century draughtsmen, equal to Annibale Carracci and Lanfranco."	1590	1649	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/3VCAmKznzIuOerJkEdgQYg/four_thirds.jpg	3	1

Gaston Lachaise was taught the refinement of European sculpture while living in France. He met a young American woman, Isabel Dutaud Nagle, and the pair moved to America, where his craft reached maturity and he was influenced and inspired by American ways. Lachaise helped redefine the female nude in a new and powerful manner. His drawings also reflected his new style of the female form.	1882	1935	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/OX9RCgCyF05g6Xn_IqZxjA/four_thirds.jpg	1	1

He was probably born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Richard and Mary Singleton Copley, both Anglo-Irish. After becoming well-established as a portrait painter of the wealthy in colonial New England, he moved to London in 1774, never returning to America. In London, he met considerable success as a portraitist for the next two decades, and also painted a number of large history paintings, which were innovative in their readiness to depict modern subjects and modern dress. His later years were less successful, and he died heavily in debt. He was father of John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst.	1738	1815	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/OB_-nG5oidN4eolnzx_Y9A/four_thirds.jpg	20	1

Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of late Italian Gothic and some Early Renaissance painting, even though they date from the latter half of the Italian Renaissance period.	1444	1510	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/u28mOc02a2H6pFFjv07ogg/four_thirds.jpg	7	1

Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.	1475	1564	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/bjSbQqqhTKoSlUxgeUcskg/four_thirds.jpg	8	1

Although he is best known for his religious works, Murillo also produced a considerable number of paintings of contemporary women and children. These lively realistic portraits of flower girls, street urchins, and beggars constitute an extensive and appealing record of the everyday life of his times. He also painted two self-portraits, one in the Frick Collection portraying him in his 30s, and one in London's National Gallery portraying him about 20 years later. In 2017–18, the two museums held an exhibition of them.	1617	1682	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/63KzTlZIfS-OxMlbKyLyIw/four_thirds.jpg	5	1

He was one of the most important painters of the 15th century Sienese School. His early works show the influence of earlier Sienese masters, but his later style was more individual, characterized by cold, harsh colours and elongated forms. His style also took on the influence of International Gothic artists such as Gentile da Fabriano. Many of his works have an unusual dreamlike atmosphere, such as the surrealistic Miracle of St. Nicholas of Tolentino painted about 1455 and now housed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, while his last works, particularly Last Judgment, Heaven, and Hell from about 1465 and Assumption painted in 1475, both at Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena), are grotesque treatments of their lofty subjects. Giovanni's reputation declined after his death but was revived in the 20th century.	1398	1482	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/5YI9qk0hGmDl713nuA-Y1g/four_thirds.jpg	4	1

From 1891 through 1900, he was a prominent member of the Nabis, making paintings which assembled areas of pure color, and interior scenes, influenced by Japanese prints, where the subjects were blended into colors and patterns. He also was a decorative artist, painting theater sets, panels for interior decoration, and designing plates and stained glass. After 1900, when the Nabis broke up, he adopted a more realistic style, painting landscapes and interiors with lavish detail and vivid colors. In the 1920s and 1930s he painted portraits of prominent figures in French industry and the arts in their familiar settings.	1868	1940	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/DXE5aBQ_efi1LuWiMjn9Vw/four_thirds.jpg	53	1
248	George Bellows	Linked with the urban realists of the Ashcan school, Bellows gained renown for his direct and unsentimental portrayals of early twentieth-century city life. The Columbus, Ohio-born artist played semi-pro baseball before moving to New York, and his lifelong fascination with athletics led him to explore the then illicit world of prizefighting, capturing on canvas the rawness and excitement of the often brutal confrontations. Bellows also painted portraits of friends and family members, as well as seascapes and landscapes, particularly of the rugged Maine coast and the area around Woodstock, New York, where he spent summers after 1920. \n\nOne of the few American artists of his era who did not study abroad, Bellows attended classes at the Art Students League of New York with Robert Henri. In addition to his oil painting, he worked as an illustrator to supplement his income, and began to produce lithographs after 1916. Though trained in America, he was keenly interested in European art, and had a hand in the organization of the groundbreaking 1913 Armory Show. Bellows' unsentimental early portrayals of boxers and tenement dwellers are executed in a loose, impressionistic painting style, using bold brushstrokes and a subdued palette. His later works reveal the influence of modern theories of color and composition in which he immersed himself before his untimely death from complications of appendicitis at the height of his career.	1882	1925	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/OkpW427w37Sx9VxHXzqdoQ/four_thirds.jpg	32	1

130	Winslow Homer	One of the most universally acclaimed realist painters America has produced, Homer is particularly known for his scenes of outdoor life. The Boston-born artist began his career as an illustrator for Harper's (after an apprenticeship in lithography), reporting pictorially from the Civil War battlefront. The war and its aftermath became a source of imagery for him as he began to concentrate on oil painting, making his first visit to Europe in late 1866, and achieving rapid critical success. While summering in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1873, Homer first began to paint seriously in watercolor; it would eventually become his primary medium, allowing him to explore nuances of light, color, and composition in a fluid and spontaneous manner. \n\nHomer's outdoor genre scenes encompassed a variety of subjects, including children and young adults (often in summertime leisure pursuits), wilderness guides, and rural blacks in the post-Civil War era. In 1881, he spent almost two years in the fishing village of Cullercoats, on the coast of England, depicting local residents in their daily activities. Increasingly, Homer began painting the sea, and the struggle between man and the wilder side of nature became a dominant theme for him as he moved permanently to Prout's Neck, a high, rocky, secluded spot on Maine's Atlantic coast. An avid outdoorsman, Homer took annual fishing trips to the Adirondacks, Florida, Bermuda, and the Bahamas, and all of these places provided subject matter for his work. Homer's oils are powerfully painted, employing strong contrasts and making full use of the weight and bulk of the oil medium, while his watercolors reveal a lighter, more sensitive touch, capturing his subjects with a fluency and immediacy that influenced generations of artists to come.	1836	1910	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/FZjpLFnOb2Onqlo5XLC0Rg/four_thirds.jpg	73	1
139	Augustus Saint-Gaudens	Augustus Saint-Gaudens was an American sculptor of the Beaux-Arts generation who embodied the ideals of the American Renaissance.

After he returned to New York, he achieved major critical success for his monuments commemorating heroes of the American Civil War, many of which still stand. Saint-Gaudens created works such as the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial on Boston Common, Abraham Lincoln: The Man, and grand equestrian monuments to Civil War generals: General John Logan Memorial in Chicago's Grant Park and William Tecumseh Sherman at the corner of New York's Central Park. In addition, he created the popular historicist representation of The Puritan.	1848	1907	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/sOBgs1ZcWRPK-97LgfMo8w/four_thirds.jpg	8	1
144	John Frederick Kensett	John Frederick Kensett was an American\nlandscape painter and engraver born in Cheshire, Connecticut. He was a member of the second generation of the Hudson River School of artists. Kensett's signature works are landscape paintings of New England and New York State, whose clear light and serene surfaces celebrate transcendental qualities of nature, and are associated with Luminism. Kensett's early work owed much to the influence of Thomas Cole, but was from the outset distinguished by a preference for cooler colors and an interest in less dramatic topography, favoring restraint in both palette and composition. The work of Kensett's maturity features tranquil scenery depicted with a spare geometry, culminating in series of paintings in which coastal promontories are balanced against glass-smooth water. He was a founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.	1816	1872	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ubv1_AWYZsyOyfRUMtsDzA/four_thirds.jpg	4	1
154	John Singer Sargent	The most sought-after society portraitist of his time, as well as a highly accomplished painter of landscapes and genre scenes, Sargent was born in Florence to well-to-do American parents. The French-trained Sargent depicted his sitters with a bravura brushstroke and a degree of originality that were highly progressive at the time. As a result, he enjoyed critical notice and important patronage, but also weathered some controversy. Though he spent most of his life abroad, his American ties brought him numerous portrait commissions as well as important commissions for the mural programs at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and the Boston Public Library. \n\nSargent's works, whether in oil, watercolor, or charcoal, are marked with naturalness and a distinct sense of immediacy due to his remarkable technical facility as an artist. Whether monumental portraits or casual outdoor scenes, his works possess a freshness and fluidity seldom matched in any era. Sargent spent much of his free time painting and sketching outdoors, and his landscapes and outdoor genre scenes -- influenced by his friendship with Claude Monet and frequently executed in watercolor -- depict the various locations he visited, including Italy, rural England, Giverny, the Mediterranean, northern Africa, and the Alps. The artist devoted a large portion of his late career to his mural projects, and also served as a war artist during World War I.	1856	1925	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/BWSu3vf0xliBCpYAsc6Rqw/four_thirds.jpg	13	1

158	Childe Hassam	One of the most celebrated and well-known of the American impressionists, Hassam created works documenting his wide travels and his inclination toward the picturesque and agreeable aspects of the world around him. He worked as an illustrator early in his career, and the sharp eye he developed in that occupation encouraged him to seek out the pictorial possibilities wherever he went, from the streets of Paris to the shipyards of New England to the deserts of eastern Oregon. His series of flag paintings, which depict the parades proceeding up New York's Fifth Avenue during World War I, are some of the most iconic images in American art. \n\nHassam combined his intense interest in the effects of light as well as the animated brushwork and vivid color (after the mid-1880s) that typify impressionist painting with a more substantial use of forms and volumes to arrive at his signature style. His works flicker with color and light, but retain a sense of solidity and recognizable space. Whether executed in watercolor, oil or pastel, Hassam's lively landscape scenes capture the scenic appeal of places including Appledore, Cos Cob, Old Lyme, and East Hampton, (where he spent summers); the streets of New York and Paris; and the countryside of Normandy and Brittany. A founding member of the Ten American Painters, Hassam also painted nudes and figural works, including a series of window compositions that combined still-life elements and female figures in interiors silhouetted against views of the New York skyline. The artist's great ingenuity led him to take up etching at age 55, where he concentrated particularly on architectural subjects.	1859	1935	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/c51YGpOMfurO80T_sLWtZQ/four_thirds.jpg	20	1
187	Clarence H. White	Clarence Hudson White was an American photographer, teacher and a founding member of the Photo-Secession movement. He grew up in small towns in Ohio, where his primary influences were his family and the social life of rural America. After visiting the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, he took up photography. Although he was completely self-taught in the medium, within a few years he was internationally known for his pictorial photographs that captured the spirit and sentimentality of America in the early twentieth century.\nAs he became well known for his images, White was sought out by other photographers who often traveled to Ohio to learn from him. He became friends with Alfred Stieglitz and helped advance the cause of photography as a true art form. In 1906 White and his family moved to New York City in order to be closer to Stieglitz and his circle and to further promote his own work. While there he became interested in teaching photography and in 1914 he established the Clarence H. White School of Photography, the first educational institution in America to teach photography as art. Due to the demands of his teaching duties, his own photography declined and White produced little new work during the last decade of his life. In 1925 he suffered a heart attack and died while teaching students in Mexico City.	1871	1925	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/565noHWjARIjvOFxz33uaA/square.jpg	7	1
206	Giovanni Paolo Panini	Giovanni Paolo Panini or Pannini was an Italian painter and architect who worked in Rome and is primarily known as one of the vedutisti. As a painter, Panini is best known for his vistas of Rome, in which he took a particular interest in the city's antiquities. Among his most famous works are his view of the interior of the Pantheon, and his vedute—paintings of picture galleries containing views of Rome. Most of his works, especially those of ruins, have a fanciful and unreal embellishment characteristic of capriccio themes. In this they resemble the capricci of Marco Ricci. Panini also painted portraits, including one of Pope Benedict XIV.	1691	1765	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/13dNcwbjYMxjsPGpV3Levg/four_thirds.jpg	2	1
208	Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio	Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, known as simply Caravaggio, was an Italian painter active in Rome for most of his artistic life. During the final four years of his life he moved between Naples, Malta, and Sicily until his death. His paintings have been characterized by art critics as combining a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, which had a formative influence on Baroque painting.	1571	1610	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/4z6Ljl5oS506sk_0ZbOq6w/four_thirds.jpg	5	1
213	Vittore Carpaccio	Vittore Carpaccio (UK: /kɑːrˈpætʃ oʊ/, US: /-ˈpɑːtʃ-/, Italian: [vitˈtoːre karˈpattʃo]; was an Italian painter of the Venetian school who studied under Gentile Bellini. Carpaccio was largely influenced by the style of the early Italian Renaissance painter Antonello da Messina, as well as Early Netherlandish painting. Although often compared to his mentor Gentile Bellini, Vittore Carpaccio’s command of perspective, precise attention to architectural detail, themes of death, and use of bold color differentiated him from other Italian Renaissance artists. Many of his works display the religious themes and cross-cultural elements of art at the time; his portrayal of St. Augustine in His Study from 1502, reflects the popularity of collecting "exotic" and highly desired objects from different cultures.	1465	1520	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ysZVO9zVMpYJUli5U2UyOw/four_thirds.jpg	4	1
276	Jusepe de Ribera	Jusepe de Ribera was a painter and printmaker, who along with Francisco de Zurbarán, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, and the singular Diego Velázquez, are regarded as the major artists of Spanish Baroque painting. Referring to a series of Ribera exhibitions held in the late 20th century, Philippe de Montebello wrote "If Ribera's status as the undisputed protagonist of Neapolitan painting had ever been in doubt, it was not longer. Indeed, to many it seemed that Ribera emerged from these exhibitions as not simply the greatest Neapolitan artist of his age but one of the outstanding European masters of the seventeenth century." Jusepe de Ribera has also been referred to as José de Ribera, Josep de Ribera, and Lo Spagnoletto by his contemporaries, early historians, and biographers.	1591	1652	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/fHJiLtSnglc_E1Scx7q9_A/four_thirds.jpg	4	1

298	Maurice Brazil Prendergast	An innovative painter whose work pioneered some of the latest developments in American art, Prendergast is associated with post-Impressionism and considered one of the first American modernists. Although he exhibited with The Eight, most of who were interested in gritty urban realism, Prendergast preferred to depict his subjects in more pleasant and picturesque surroundings. He is particularly known for his cheerful and bright beach and park scenes. The Canadian-born Prendergast moved with his family to Boston at an early age, and traveled abroad a number of times as an adult. Early in his career, he worked primarily in watercolor, but developed a strong interest in oils during the first decade of the 20th century and also produced a large number of monotypes. \n\nPrendergast's colorful works are characterized by vivid surface patterning and recurring use of curvilinear forms-often the parasols that provide shade to the park visitors and beachgoers populating his compositions. These flat colored shapes and forms remain as bright in the foreground as they are in the background, lending a highly decorative, almost mosaic-like quality to his works. Prendergast also painted still lifes, and occasionally worked with his brother Charles, a painter and framemaker, on other projects, including designs for the ornamental frames that sometimes accompany his work.	1858	1924	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/vUaNapr09GcPBHdLD82QSA/four_thirds.jpg	10	1

She is considered one of the most important representatives of early expressionism, producing more than 700 paintings and over 1000 drawings during her active painting life. She is recognized both as the first known woman painter to paint nude self-portraits, and the first woman to have a museum devoted exclusively to her art. Additionally, she is considered to be the first woman artist to depict herself both pregnant and nude and pregnant.	1876	1907	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/7rsdv52l5fB7HkZCq--WvQ/four_thirds.jpg	3	1

Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau "brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in Jupiter and Semele." He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, "Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new." The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters.	1826	1898	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/H7zlJ5d6NQNHqU4y1XmQYg/four_thirds.jpg	1	1

346	Julian Alden Weir	Born into an artistic family, Weir was a founding member of the Ten American Painters and became one of the most prominent artists of his generation. His father, Robert Weir (an art instructor at the United States Military Academy), provided his early training, and J. Alden initially began painting in an established academic style, refined by later study in New York and Paris. Unlike many of his peers, Weir enjoyed notable success as a painter and teacher before he ever began to work in an impressionist manner. He concentrated on portraits, figural works, and still lifes, and these works exhibit rigorous structure, dramatic use of dark and light, and bold handling of pigment. \n\nAs Weir became increasingly interested in landscape painting after the purchase of his farm in Branchville, Connecticut (now a National Historic Site), he began to work in a more impressionistic mode, encouraged by his experiments in pastel and watercolor, as well as by his friendships with John Twachtman and Theodore Robinson. Weir gradually adopted the looser brushwork of the impressionist style, altering perspective and flattening forms while choosing to work in a softer color palette than that favored by the more radical practitioners of impressionism. His landscape works include scenes of the western Connecticut hills; Cornish, New Hampshire; the factory landscapes of central Connecticut; and the environs of Cos Cob, Connecticut, where he taught a summer painting class.	1852	1919	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/51WlFOIsC0N_idr4zFr7yA/four_thirds.jpg	7	1

437	William Holman Hunt	William Holman Hunt was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid colour, and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximise the popular appeal and public visibility of his works.	1827	1910	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/bez2D6UxUD60KrstVSr9qQ/four_thirds.jpg	2	1
471	Ammi Phillips	Ammi Phillips was a prolific American itinerant portrait painter active from the mid 1810s to the early 1860s in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. His artwork is identified as folk art, primitive art, provincial art, and itinerant art without consensus among scholars, pointing to the enigmatic nature of his work and life. He is attributed to over eight hundred paintings, although only eleven are signed. While his paintings are formulaic in nature, Phillips paintings were under constant construction, evolving as he added or discarded what he found successful, while taking care to add personal details that spoke to the identity of those who hired him. He is most famous for his portraits of children in red, although children only account for ten percent of his entire body of work. The most well known of this series, Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, would be sold for one million dollars, a first for folk art. His paintings hung mostly unidentified, spare for some recognition in the collections like those of Edward Duff Balken, for decades until his oeuvre was reconstructed by Barbara Holdridge and Larry Holdridge, collectors and students of American folk art, with the support of the art historian Mary Black. Ammi Phillip's body of work was expanded upon their discovery that the mysterious paintings of a "Kent Limner" and "Border Limner" were indeed his.	1788	1865	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/4JUK6idXaJ-ICejprbLxhQ/four_thirds.jpg	3	1

Becoming, after his early death, one of the most influential British artists of his time, the facility of his style was inspired by the old masters, yet was entirely modern in its application. His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical cabinet paintings in a freely-handled version of the troubadour style.	1802	1828	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/7AOa7Ea-7sEIL0zQkarplw/four_thirds.jpg	8	1

His patronage extended to the nobility, and he often collaborated with other artists such as Antonio Visentini and Bernardo Bellotto. In 1768, Zuccarelli became a founding member of the Royal Academy of Arts, and upon his final return to Italy, he was elected president of the Venetian Academy. In addition to his rural landscapes which frequently incorporated religious and classical themes, Zuccarelli created devotional pieces and on occasion did portraiture. Beside paintings, his varied output included etchings, drawings, and designs for tapestries as well as a set of Old Testament playing cards.	1702	1788	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/qjEnRnN8JOcsxnb4eps6zw/four_thirds.jpg	3	1
583	Francis Frith	Francis Frith was an English photographer of the Middle East and many towns in the United Kingdom.\nFrith was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, attending Quaker schools at Ackworth and Quaker Camp Hill in Birmingham, before he started in the cutlery business. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1843, recuperating over the next two years. In 1850 he started a photographic studio in Liverpool, known as Frith & Hayward. A successful grocer, and later, printer, Frith fostered an interest in photography, becoming a founding member of the Liverpool Photographic Society in 1853. Frith sold his companies in 1855 in order to dedicate himself entirely to photography. He journeyed to the Middle East on three occasions, the first of which was a trip to Egypt in 1856 with very large cameras. He used the collodion process, a major technical achievement in hot and dusty conditions.	1822	1898	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/l6dCNyS-uM9KJy1GbKsvXg/four_thirds.jpg	3	1
612	Marco Dente	Marco Dente da Ravenna (1493–1527), usually just called Marco Dente, was an Italian engraver born in Ravenna in the latter part of the 15th Century. He was a prominent figure within the circle of printmakers around Marcantonio Raimondi in Rome, and is known for the imitative nature of the reproductive prints or close copies of other prints that were most of his output. His prints in specific cases are also of certain interest in that we can see the impact and design of sculptural restorations. Marco Dente was killed in the tumult of the Sack of Rome in 1527. He used the accompanying monogram, D-B; albeit sparingly.	1493	1527	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/jTqivUx_mKB8m8oiXJGQQg/four_thirds.jpg	2	1
615	Pieter Jansz. Saenredam	Pieter Jansz. Saenredam was a painter of the Dutch Golden Age, known for his distinctive paintings of whitewashed church interiors such as Interior of St Bavo's Church in Haarlem and Interior of the Sint-Odulphuskerk in Assendelft.	1597	1665	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/wlcphySRLhYUoouSwwvX6Q/four_thirds.jpg	5	1
646	Sir James Thornhill	Sir James Thornhill was an English painter of historical subjects working in the Italian baroque tradition. He was responsible for some large-scale schemes of murals, including the "Painted Hall" at the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, the paintings on the inside of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and works at Chatsworth House and Wimpole Hall.	1675	1734	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Lm36s069hpTCOI7QOdm8vQ/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
651	Joseph Badger	Joseph Badger was a portrait artist in Boston, Massachusetts, in the 18th century. He was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, to tailor Stephen Badger and Mercy Kettell. He "began his career as a house-painter and glazier, and ... throughout his life continued this work, besides painting signs, hatchments and other heraldic devices, in order to eke out a livelihood when orders for portraits slackened." In 1731 he married Katharine Felch; they moved to Boston around 1733. He was a member of the Brattle Street Church. He died in Boston on May 11, 1765, when "on Saturday last one Mr. Badger, of this Town, Painter, was taken with an Apoplectic Fit as he was walking in his Garden, and expired in a few Minutes after." Works by Badger are in the collections of the Worcester Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, and Historic New England's Phillips House, Salem, Mass. While respected in his own time, subsequent scholars and connoisseurs largely overlooked Badger's significance until Lawrence Park wrote a book about him in 1918.	1708	1765	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/IEzMbKlEK88wyoLOB2WbwQ/four_thirds.jpg	2	1
684	William Daniell	William Daniell (1769–1837) was an English landscape and marine painter, and printmaker, notable for his work in aquatint. He travelled extensively in India in the company of his uncle Thomas Daniell, with whom he collaborated on one of the finest illustrated works of the period – Oriental Scenery. He later travelled around the coastline of Britain to paint watercolours for the equally ambitious book A Voyage Round Great Britain. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution and he became a Royal Academician in 1822.	1769	1837	https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/KxqmleswvBfJ2aWVs9Z-iA/four_thirds.jpg	1	1
